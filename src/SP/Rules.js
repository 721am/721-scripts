      <p>A daily prize of 1,000,000 $SP is split among active Streakers based on their total points. If the daily prize is a big ass pizza, you get a bigger slice by accumulating more on-chain points. More points = More $SP.</p>
      <p>You gain +1 on-chain point every day you extend your streak. Using your referral link earns you +1 additional point for every new Streaker you refer. More on-chain games where you can accumulate more points are coming soon.</p>
